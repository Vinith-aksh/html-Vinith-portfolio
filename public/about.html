<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A Mechanical engineering Graduate, who once completed the graduation on 2016 started off to get in to a public service.
  Days and years passed, where i couldn't find the right path and started my career as an Customer service associate in an 
  e-commerce sector, later i developed my skills and have reached the place of leading a team.</p>

<p>However days go on, I couldn't find my role challenging, where i need to do the daily tasks ahain and again. Also i have 
  a small thought of building a small scale business that too in an ecommerce sector and so i started researching and found that
  atleast to be sucessfull in our early business. We need a understanding of Marketing, Customer service and then comes the website 
  handling.</p>

<p>On reasearching i found out that full stack course will be very helpful to create and handle a website and so i got a curiosity 
  to learn above this Front-end coding, Back end coding etc. So i thought of learning it from scratch which can provide me a better career,
  as well as can be helpful for my future goals as well.</p>
